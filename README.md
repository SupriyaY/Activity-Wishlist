# Activity WishList

## Overview

My move to Atlanta, Georgia, along with my future travel aspirations inspired me to formulate my idea for this application.  I wanted to create an application that I could use to log the places I want to visit and the acitivities I want to do when I arrive. Booking a flight is easy, however creating a plan can be challenging task.  My application allows you to list the places you wish to visit and add the activites you want to do.

## Technology Used

* Languages - HTML5, CSS3
* Frameworks - Node.js
* Project Planning and User Stories  - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/J5TmVQe1/project-2-activity-wishlist)

## Wireframes and ERD

Figma was the tool used to design the prototype for the application.

## Features

* RESTful routes for users model(get, post, put, and delete)
* Mongo queries using Mongoose module interacting with database

The purpose of the application is to organize the places and activities a user is interested in visiting.  A user has the ability to create a profile, and then add a city and activies within the city. Once an activity is added to the profile, a user can add specific details to the acvitity such as the name of the place and the activity, address, and description.  In addition, there are fields to enter whether the place has been visited and if the user would recommend the activity/place to a friend.   The user has the ability to update, create, edit and/or delete their profiles.
